  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nConfigures various YUM components on Red Hat-like systems.  Includes LWRP for managing repositories and their GPG keys.\n\nBased on the work done by Eric Wolfe and Charles Duffy on the yumrepo cookbook. http://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbooks/tree/yumrepo/yumrepo\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n## v.0.1.2:\n\n* Remove yum update in default recipe, that doesn't update caches, it\n  updates packages installed.\n\nRequirements\n============\nRHEL, CentOS or Scientific Linux 5.x or newer. It has not been tested on other platforms or earlier versions. RHEL 6 support is untested (testing and patches are welcome).\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\nThe default recipe runs `yum update` during the Compile Phase of the Chef run to ensure that the system's package cache is updated with the latest. It is recommended that this recipe appear first in a node's run list (directly or through a role) to ensure that when installing packages, Chef will be able to download the latest version available on the remote YUM repository.\n\nyum\n---\nManages the configuration of the `/etc/yum.conf` via attributes.\n\nResources/Providers\n===================\n\nkey\n---\nThis LWRP handles importing GPG keys for YUM repositories. Keys can be imported by the `url` parameter or placed in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/` by a recipe and then installed with the LWRP without passing the URL.\n\n# Actions\n- :add: installs the GPG key into `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`\n- :remove: removes the GPG key from `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`\n\n# Attribute Parameters\n\n- key: name attribute. The name of the GPG key to install.\n- url: if the key needs to be downloaded, the URL providing the download.\n\n# Example\n\n``` ruby\n# add the Zenoss GPG key\nyum_key \"RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss\" do\n  url \"http://dev.zenoss.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss\"\n  action :add\nend\n    \n# remove Zenoss GPG key\nyum_key \"RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss\" do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\nrepository\n----------\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional YUM repositories. GPG keys can be managed with the `key` LWRP.\n\n# Actions\n\n- :add: creates a repository file and builds the repository listing\n- :remove: removes the repository file\n\n# Attribute Parameters\n\n- repo_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover\n- description. The description of the repository\n- url: The URL providing the packages\n- mirrorlist: Default is `false`,  if `true` the `url` is considered a list of mirrors\n- key: Optional, the name of the GPG key file installed by the `key` LWRP.\n- enabled: Default is `1`, set to `0` if the repository is disabled.\n- type: Optional, alternate type of repository\n- failovermethod: Optional, failovermethod\n- bootstrapurl: Optional, bootstrapurl\n\n# Example\n\n``` ruby\n# add the Zenoss repository\nyum_repository \"zenoss\" do\n  name \"Zenoss Stable repo\"\n  url \"http://dev.zenoss.com/yum/stable/\"\n  key \"RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss\"\n  action :add\nend\n    \n# remove Zenoss repo\nyum_repository \"zenoss\" do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nPut `recipe[yum]` first in the run list to ensure `yum update` is run before other recipes. You can manage GPG keys either with cookbook_file in a recipe if you want to package it with a cookbook or use the `url` parameter of the `key` LWRP.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Eric G.
